# nodeJs-BoilerPlate

# 🧠 Full-Stack Ready Node.js Boilerplate

This is a **production-ready backend boilerplate** built using **Node.js + Express + MongoDB(Docker)**, designed for learning, collaboration, and solid project foundation.

Built especially for **mid-level devs** who want to **truly understand what they build**, this project comes with clear structure, working routes, logging, authentication, and powerful tools.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built This

As a backend learner and hands-on developer, I often found boilerplates that were too deep or complex to start with.  
This is my take on building something that is:

- ✅ Clean and understandable
- ✅ Ready to extend into any real project
- ✅ Friendly for learning + contribution

This boilerplate helped me:
- Strengthen my concepts in **JWT**, **error handling**, **RBAC**, **MongoDB**, and more
- Learn by doing, testing, and writing real API code
- Work on architecture that fits **MERN stack and GenAI-based systems**

---

## 🔥 My Dev Goals

I'm **actively looking for opportunities** to:

- Work on **MERN stack** projects (frontend + backend)
- Collaborate with teams or individuals on meaningful tech products
- Improve my understanding of scalable architectures, backend systems, and GenAI integration

I have:
- 💼 Practical experience in both Java and JavaScript backend stacks
- 🧠 Built and deployed projects with **MongoDB**, **JWT**, **middleware**, **role management**, and more
- 💡 A strong desire to grow and contribute to real teams

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB (via Mongoose)**
- **Docker (Mongo containerized)**
- **JWT (for auth)**
- **Helmet / CORS **
- **Winston (logging)**
- **express-validator (validation)**
- **Swagger UI (API Docs)**

## 🐳 Docker Setup

To spin up MongoDB:

```bash
docker-compose up -d - (or) in vs code direct right click and click on compose up (if docker is installed in your device and in vs code as well)
```

This will launch the default `mongo` container locally.
